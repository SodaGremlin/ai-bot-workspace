# AI Bot Workspace
An Electron application which includes testing workspaces for a few AI competitions.

## Getting up and running
First, install all dependencies using `npm install`. Then, run the application using `npm start`. Java 8 is required to run the match engines.

Prebuilt binaries are not yet available.

When launching a competition for the first time, some default settings will be loaded (these include the commands for the bots). To change those, go to File -> Settings or press Command/Control + Comma.

## Included competitions
- Riddles.io
  - [Hack Man](https://booking.riddles.io/competitions/hack-man)
  - [Light Riders](https://starapple.riddles.io/competitions/light-riders)
  - [AI Block Battle](https://playground.riddles.io/competitions/ai-block-battle) (also available on [The AI Games](http://theaigames.com/competitions/ai-block-battle))
  - [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](https://playground.riddles.io/competitions/ultimate-tic-tac-toe) (also available on [The AI Games](http://theaigames.com/competitions/ultimate-tic-tac-toe))

## Credits
This application would not be possible without the game engines, match wrapper and match viewers. All of these were made by the awesome people over at [Riddles.io](https://github.com/riddlesio) & [The AI Games](https://github.com/theaigames).
