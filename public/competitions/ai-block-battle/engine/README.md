## Changes made to the engine
The engine now supports only 2 or 3 arguments. If 2 are given, it plays just as the official engine. If 3 are given, the first 2 arguments are taken as bot commands, while the 3th is the path where the resultfile is saved. This resultfile is in JSON and is much like the Hack Man and Light Riders contests, and can be easily parsed and given to the match viewer.
